### Design

## Description 
A web application that can pull someone's games played on chess.com, use stockfish to analyse the pulled games to find weak points in play, prompt the user to make a better move on a chessboard in the application, give feed back on the new move played so that the user can improve their chess game, and finally either get rid of the position if they played a strong move or keep it if they played a weak one.
