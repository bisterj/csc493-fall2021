# Project Name
Chess Trainer (might be changed later)
## Goals
To collect previously played games, analyse said games to find weak points in the players game,
and to create the opportunity for the player to develop better moves in the same position. 
## Context
The context of this project is that both myself and people all around the world are playing chess and need better ways to 
study chess. Other resources don't collect weak moves from all of your games but rather analyse one game at a time (Chess.com game review function). 
## Novelty
The chess trainers I have seen either ignore the players previous games all together and just teach concepts and tactics
from their own fabricated positions, or they evaluate weak points in a players singular game. What I want to do is to create an application that would look across all previous games, creating a list of positions where they played weakly and be able to give them a chance to find better positions. 
## Functionality
Needs to be able to collect the users games from online, use stockfish to find weak moves, be able to 
present the position again and let the player play a move, and lastly analyse the players new move so that they can know 
if they have found a better alternative or not. 
## Audience
Chess players who play at least some games online, since I am planning on collecting online games to analyse. 
## Challenges
Collecting games from online chess websites might be hard to do for other users because of permissions. 
## Measures
The measures of success are going to be if I can get this up and running. In other words; can I collect the users games, analyse them, present positions they play weak moves from, let them play a move, analyse said move and present some feedback on whether they have done better or not. 
## Motivation
I am someone who enjoys playing chess and I wanted to have an opportunity to fix weaknesses in my chess playing, by looking at weakpoints across all my games. 
## Future Extensions
Adding other educational resources to help players learn to play chess stronger, also using ai could help pinpoint the weaknesses in their games.
