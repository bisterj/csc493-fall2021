# Chess Trainer
## Description/Motivation

Create a web application that will collect previously played games and analyse these games to find weak points in the users 
game. Then presents the positions that the user has played weakly previously and give them the opportunity to play a stronger move. 

### Concept
[Concept.md](concept.md)

### Scope

The scope of my chess trainer is that it will use the users previously played games to create opportunities for the user to improve. Specifically, this will be done by analysis of previously played games and presenting the user with weak points in these games, to give them the opportunity to played better/stronger moves. My project will not include a functional chess game to be played against a computer or other people nor an opening explorer (This could be a small thing to be done for further developement but not in the scope of this class). It will not have resources available to help you study ideas in general such as endgames, tactics, checkmates, and openings. It will also not have any way to group the weak points (might be an extension).

### Vision

My project is being built to provide a new alternate way to study chess, through preparing weak points in the users game as 
the primary tool to get better at chess. 

### Prerequisites

Nothing will be required to downlowad, it will be a web application.
